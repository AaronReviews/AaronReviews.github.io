    "You may be taking your first steps in music, seeking extra tuition ahead of GCSE / A level exams, or revisiting an old passion. Whatever your circumstance and musical taste, I take a student-first approach to teaching and will support you with whatever you want to achieve.",
    "I offer students the opportunity to sit exams with the ABRSM, arguably the most prestigious examining board in the world. These courses will not only improve your technical playing abilities, but they also teach you valuable musicianship skills like picking up melodies by ear and understanding musical principles such as harmony and tonality. In the last 20 years, not a single student of mine has failed and, at a higher level, ABRSM certificates provide UCAS points.",
    "It's never too early or late to start and the first lesson is completely free. Email me at [email] if you would like to learn more / book a trial lesson or call [phone]."
