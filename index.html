<h3>New Site Launch</h3><p>All content from the previous site will remain there as a relic to the journey so far. Only new content will feature on this site</p>
<h3>Looking For a Reviewer?</h3><p>This project is totally independant and non-profit and I will review any music related content. I am, however, open to persuasion*. My persuasion tiers are:</p>
<li>Top tier: Â£5,000. Guaranteed positive review. Contact me for BACS info.</li>
<li>Middle tier: 10,000 prostitutes in a helicopter. Any negative comments will be followed up by positive comments. You are responsible for the chopper.</li>
<li>Bottom tier: blowjob in a limousine. Guaranteed mediocre review or better. I choose who blows.</li>
<h3>Contact me</h3><p>Send me your content for review! Email me <a href="mailto:aaron51connelly@gmail.com">here.</a></p>

<h1>COVID-19 Ongoing Updates</h1>
<p>Bojo's made big moves in relaxing lockdown rules, hinting at the return of live gigs sooner than we all thought. This is a good thing considering there's a lot of new lockdown music that needs to be promoted  
but does that mean it's now safe to attend gatherings? Probably not. After all, we're still seeing high numbers of deaths and new cases daily.
When we're finally back up and running, what will gigs look like? Share your thoughts in the Reviews of my reviews page.</p>

<p class="footer" align="center">*Disclosure: This is a satirical website. Although the content I review is 100% real and legitimate, any references to bribery, payments or similar content is not a reflection of real life events or acceptable propositions. I do not accept bribery, payments or "gifts". 
Aaron Reviews is an independent, non-profit project founded by Aaron Connelly as a tool for emerging artists to platform their content. 
Don't follow this  project on Facebook, I haven't made a page on there. Don't follow us on Twitter, Youtube or Instagram either. If you think you're following us on any social medias you're probably following a creep. 
Thank you Dick Platt for doing no work for free and special thanks to Tom Hollands' nipples for helping me nail the visuals.</p>
