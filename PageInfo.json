            "<p class=\"text\">Jenny Ivas has decades of experience in playing music and piano tuition, accumulating a varied musical diet ranging from classical composers such as Mozart and Beethoven to contemporary music by the likes of Sinatra, Queen and more. Her students range across many different age groups and aspiration levels, working at the speed and intensity best suited to each individual pupil. She has exceptional knowledge in not only playing music, but understanding it; alongside teaching students how to play and read music, she can help students understand music theory, an important aspect of music which is needed in both the GCSE and A level exam curricula.</p>",

            "<p class=\"text\">Jenny submits students for examinations with the Associated Board of the Royal School of Music (ABRSM) for those who wish. This prestigious music exam consists of performing three selected pieces, showing technical abilities on the piano and answering questions about music theory. Jenny has an incredible 100% pass rate since 2002 and has taken students through all grade levels. However, none of her students are forced to sit exams and any student may take lessons simply for the enjoyment of playing.</p>",

        "About": [
            "<p class=\"text\">I teach all ages from young to old not only piano, but other musical skills such as harmony and aural training. I get on well with people, relating to youngsters as well as adults, and feel I am a patient teacher and encourage parents of young students to sit in on lessons if both parent and student are happy to do so. I teach things thoroughly and work at a pace suitable for each individual.</p>",
            "<p class=\"text\">With over 20 years experience of private teaching I embrace a varied musical diet such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Queen, Billy Joel, Scott Joplin, Frank Sinatra, Adele etc. and offer support with the music GCSE and A level syllabus. For Academic music GCSE and A level work, a lot of the work is practically based. So, as a piano tutor, I am always willing to play a role in teaching and developing piano work for their exams, whether it be an integral role such as choosing and teaching music or playing the second part of a piano duet, or a backseat role like simply giving opinions or advice when asked. </p>",
            "<p class=\"text\">I currently use the Associated Board of the Royal School of Music (ABRSM) for students who wish to sit exams, though not everyone wants to take exams and thats fine. I have an excellent success rate with the ABRSM but I believe it is more important to maintain a good balance between students enjoying playing piano and building their own repertoire and then sitting exams when they wish. </p>",
            "<p class=\"text\">Some of my past students have gone on to make successful careers out of music: one ex-student became the guitarist for Errol Browns group <i>Hot Chocolate </i>, and another is playing as a session musician with a number of bands ranging from jazz to two-tone to heavy metal, all while comfortably playing renditions of Mozart and Chopin music. Another ex-student of mine has gone on to specialise in composition and is currently working tirelessly for the opportunity to have his work published. The majority of my ex-students do continue playing for fun after their lessons have ended even if they do not wish to pursue musical careers. I try to keep in touch with my former students and will always offer to lend them a hand should they ever need it again. </p>"

            "<p class=\"text\">For students who want to follow a graded exam system, Jenny submits students for examinations with the Associated Board of the Royal School of Music (ABRSM) if they wish. This consists of up to 8 graded practical exams and optional music theory exams (except in order to proceed to grade 6 in practical exams, you must pass the grade 5 theory exam). </p><br />",
            "<p class=\"text\">The practical exams take 12 minutes, with tests getting longer after grade 4. The test is marked using 4 major criteria: </p><br />",
            "<li><b>performances</b> - three pieces chosen by the ABRSM <i>(90 marks)</i> </li>",
            "<li><b>scales</b> - <i>(21 marks)</i></li>",
            "<li><b>sight reading</b> - <i>(21 marks)</i></li>",

            "<p class=\"text\">For musicians who wish to sit a grade 6 practical exam, they must first pass not only the grade 5 practical exam but also pass the grade 5 theory exam. Theory exams are designed to supply musicians with an understanding of the fundaments of music. You do not need to have sat music theory grades 1-4 before sitting the grade 5 theory test.</p><br />",
            "<p class=\"text\">The exam is marked out of 100 and will question students on their knowledge of key musical techniques such as harmony, melody, rhythm, dynamics and other frequently used music markings.</p><br />",
